BIG THANKS TO ARELDIR, WHOSE STUFF STILL FESTERS IN THIS MOD

MAKE SURE THEY ARE LOADED IN THAT ORDER

NOTES ABOUT EARLY ALPHA TESTING:

- A lot of text isn't written yet, which includes dialogue

- Some troop spawns might be odd, please inform me of issues related to such

- Slaver parties might be too strong and unfun. If so, speak on it

- The troops you see are not yet finalised and their stats are not even up to date with current standards

- (PH) means placeholder. The troop is there until I can design a more suitable substitute

- (SI) means Shattered Imperium, which means the troop is going to be phased out and is only kept for testing purposes

- Currently on the lookout for a OnHeroComesOfAge related crash. If this happens, please let me know and I'll note that down
